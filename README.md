Plugin designed to simplify creation of custom recipes, without the need writing any code or touching data-packs.
You can attach common metadata (amount, name, lore) as well as NBT tags to items processed by the recipes.
Format is very similar to the one used by data-packs.

<br />

## Usage
You can place your recipes inside the `recipes` folder, or any sub-folder within this directory. Plugin automatically search them recursively and add their relative path to the recipe key.

To add a new recipe just create a text file with the `.json` extension and edit it using a text editor of your choice. Functional examples can be found in the [Examples](#examples) section.

### 1.1. Config
In the config you can change the namespace of your recipes and all the messages of the plugin.
The namespace can only contain the following characters: `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-`, `/`.

Legacy formatting (`&`, `§`) is deprecated and planned to be removed in the future. Please use [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format) instead.

### 1.2. Commands
* `/nbtrecipes reload` - Reloads the recipes and the config file.
  * `nbtr.command` Permission needed to use the command.
* `/nbtrecipes list` - Lists all the recipes added by this plugin.
  * `nbtr.command` Permission needed to use the command.

## Plugin Components
Description of recipe components and their capabilities.

### 2.1. Item
Item is an object that represents an item in the recipes. It can be used as an ingredient, input or as a result.
Majority of fields are optional; in fact, the only one required is the `material`.

### 2.2. Tag
Tags, specifically material tags, may be described as groups of materials. They're an actual vanilla feature and are commonly referenced in various parts of the game.

They can be used in all ingredient or input slots, but cannot be mixed together with different choice types.
When the input field of a smelting recipe is set to tag `mincraft:boats` and result is set to `coal_block`, this allows all types of boats to be smelted into a block of coal.

Please note that some tags, including those added or modified by datapacks, may not work due to API limitations.

### 2.3. Choice
Choice represents set of items **or** a tag, which can be used in a specific ingredient or input slot.

Most ingredient or input slots are expected to consist of exactly one choice, which, if not tag, can be an array with multiple elements but keep in mind some recipe types may accept an array of choices.

Please refer to [Examples](#examples) section below for more details.

#### 2.3.1. Item(s) Choice
Can be used to select individual items, or multiple items defined as an array. If no elements have metadata specified (nbt, name, lore), the recipe will compare items based on their material.
```json5
"input": { "material": "minecraft:iron_axe", "nbt": "{Damage:157}" }
```
```json5
"input": [
  { "material": "minecraft:stone" },
  { "material": "minecraft:cobblestone" }
]
```
#### 2.3.2. Tag Choice
Can be used to select individual group of items. Recipe will compare items based on their material.
```json5
"input": { "tag": "minecraft:boats" }
```

### 2.4. Discover Trigger
Recipe discover trigger can make any recipe discoverable by players when they pick up an item.
This feature is optional and if left unspecified, the recipe will be automatically discovered and visible by default.

Please refer to [Examples](#examples) section below for more details.

<br />
